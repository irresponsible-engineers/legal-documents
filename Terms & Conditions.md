## Terms & Conditions

By downloading or using our apps, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using our apps. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify our apps, any part of our apps, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of our apps, and you also shouldn’t try to translate our apps into other languages, or make derivative versions. Our apps, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Irresponsible Engineers.

Irresponsible Engineers is committed to ensuring that our apps are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to our apps or to charge for their services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for our apps or their services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The apps may store and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to our apps secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that our apps won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Irresponsible Engineers will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of our apps will require our apps to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Irresponsible Engineers cannot take responsibility for our apps not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using our apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing our apps, or other third party charges. In using our apps, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use our apps outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using our apps, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using our apps.

Along the same lines, Irresponsible Engineers cannot always take responsibility for the way you use our apps i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Irresponsible Engineers cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Irresponsible Engineers’s responsibility for your use of our apps, when you’re using our apps, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that they are updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Irresponsible Engineers accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of our apps.

At some point, we may wish to update our apps. Our apps are currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of our apps to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using our apps. Irresponsible Engineers does not promise that it will always update its apps so that they are relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to our appslication when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing our apps, and may terminate use of them at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using our apps, and (if needed) delete them from your device.
